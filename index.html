                <p> Hello my name is Santana Owendi Iam from Nairobi,Kenya. I enjoy swimming and making new friends. I also love cooking, I would say its my passion. Iam a Dairy Technologist working for a dairy company in Kenya,Kericho. Also Iam  currently studying web development in Brigham Young University, I have always been curious about technology and so far Iam enjoying this  path i took to learn. My curiosity started when I was young, I would use my father's computer to play games and wondered how this games came to be, but never made my interest known, until in one of the Young Adults fireside held at church, they brought in someone to talk about an opportunity of learning online and one of the courses they mentioned was artificial  intelligence. I researched more about it and decided it is was eventualy I would pursue. I decided to start by studying web and software programming first, we started by learning the python language and I now know how to create games and applications, currently Iam familiarizing myself with how to develop websites.</P>

                <p> Kenya is located in the east of Africa, it is known for the diverse wildlife,national parks, and rich cultural heritage. It borders the Indian ocean, lake Victoria, Ethiopia,Somalia, South Sudan, Tanzania and Uganda. The capital is Nairobi, a very beautiful city. The first temple of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints has been erected in Kenya in 2024.Since independence Kenya has had 5 presidents, who have all in their unique way made Kenya better. Kenya is divided in counties, my favourite one is Laikipia county, its one underated county with very beautiful sites to visit. I love a place called Nanyuki, it is not that big but its a place you can get all you need, I lived there for almost two years and it was the best experience ever.</p>
